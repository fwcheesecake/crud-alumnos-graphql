# crud-alumnos-graphql

Clone the repo and run `npm install`, then run the docker containers for the database with 
`docker compose up` (this is because pgadming is also running on a separated container).

Once the containers are running run `npx prisma migrate dev` and then `npm run dev`.

To access the GraphiQL playground go to `localhost:4000/graphql`.
